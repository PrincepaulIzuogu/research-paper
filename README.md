# <span style="color:red">Will COVID_19 JUMPSTART THE DIGITAL HEALTHCARE REVOLUTION? </span> 
Abstract:  
I examined multiple sources from the internet to discuss the effect of the COVID_19 pandemic on the digital healthcare revolution.

Introduction:  
"Digital health means the use of digital technologies to improve health"(Gemma et al.,2022, para 1). Digital healthcare platform are transforming conventional changes which creates beneficial improvements  to both the citizen and government provision to society.
COVID-19 has had a serious effect at the healthcare industry, forcing a shift closer to virtual possibilities like telemedicine. The pandemic has created an environment in which the use of digital tools in healthcare is encouraged, accelerating the adoption and implementation of digital healthcare solutions.

Objective:  
This report explores the capability for the virus to jumpstart the virtual healthcare revolution and the possibilities this presents, the benefit of digital healthcare platforms during the COVID_19 pandemic, the factors that are negatively affecting the digital healthcare to become a widespread and the overall discussion.

Method:   
I gathered this information by researching multiple sources on the internet, added together with my knowledge on digital health and the COVID_19 pandemic, then I analysed these information I gathered. 

## Will COVID_19 JUMPSTART THE DIGITAL HEALTHCARE REVOLUTION? (TELEMEDICINE) 
The effect of COVID_19 on digital health has caused unpredicted disruption. "It has increased public awareness of digital healthcare, demonstrate medical value and pressure the healthcare budget"(Thomas et al.,2019, para 6). Health providers have turned to digital solutions and embraced technologies like telemedicine and remote care. This shift has positioned digital healthcare as one of the few viable options for providing patient care in the midst of the crisis. The adoption of digital healthcare by health systems and practitioners offers many advantages over traditional methods. It allows for more efficient and cost-effective care delivery, and also provides wider access to services for patients who may not be able to travel or are isolated due to regulations related to the virus. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for physical contact, making it much safer for both patients and practitioners during a time of social distancing.
Digital health technologies are not only making it easier for providers to deliver care, but they are also helping patients take a more active role in their own healthcare.

Through health app usage and wearable devices, patients can easily track their own physical activity, biometrics, exercise, diet and more. This data can then be used to identify potential problems early and provide personalized feedback on how to best manage their health. 
Telemedicine has seen significant growth over the last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It allows patients to access healthcare remotely, which reduces the risk of exposure to the virus and allows for continuity of care during lockdown periods. Telemedicine also enables increased access to healthcare services in rural and underserved communities, as well as providing many medical services that would otherwise be unavailable or cost prohibitive. However, there are still challenges to overcome, such as data security and privacy, lack of reimbursement for telemedicine services, and inadequate infrastructure in some areas. Despite its limitations, digital healthcare has already proven to be an invaluable tool in helping people stay healthy and receive care during one of the most difficult medical crises in history.
Digital healthcare-related investments have also seen an increase since March 2020, "With the global digital healthcare market expected to grow to more than $200 billion by 2024"(Statista,2022, para 2). Healthcare providers are quickly adapting to these new challenges and digital transformation initiatives have started making a positive impact across the healthcare industry.


### BENEFITS OF DIGITAL HEALTHCARE DURING COVID_19 PANDEMIC
The benefits of digital healthcare in regards to COVID-19 include faster diagnosis and contact tracing, enhanced communication between healthcare providers, patients, and families, improved remote care for those with limited access to health services, the ability to quickly deploy screening and monitoring technologies, and increased access to medical advice. Digital healthcare technologies can also help to reduce the burden on overburdened healthcare systems, as well as increase the accuracy and speed of public health interventions. "The use of digital healthcare platforms during the Covid-19 pandemic can enhance the safety of healthcare consumers because it reduces infection rates using digital meeting tools such as Zoom"(Fawaz,2021,para 20).
The use of digital health technologies is becoming increasingly popular in hospitals, pharmacies, clinics, doctor's offices and other healthcare institutions. These technologies allow access to real-time medical information, making diagnosis and treatment easier and faster. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning can help improve accuracy and efficiency in diagnosing COVID_19 or providing treatment plans. Big data analytics can also be used to gain insights into COVID_19 trends and to identify high-risk patient populations.


#### CHALLENGES FOR DIGITAL HEALTHCARE WIDESPREAD ADOPTION
Some of the challenges that must be addressed in order for digital healthcare to become more widespread include issues related to data privacy and security, the need for user-friendly interfaces, interoperability between systems, and the availability of reliable internet connections. There is also a need to ensure that medical professionals are appropriately trained and certified to use digital healthcare systems. Furthermore, digital healthcare solutions should also be rigorously tested and proven to be effective before being deployed.
 Moreover, there is a need to develop appropriate regulatory frameworks that ensure that digital healthcare solutions are safe and effective. 
 
##### OVERALL DISCUSSION 
Though there is no guarantee that digital healthcare will be adopted on a large scale due to the pandemic, it is clear that the current situation has undoubtedly affected the digital healthcare revolution by pushing providers to improve their technological capabilities and think more creatively about how they can provide adequate care remotely.
It remains to be seen whether COVID-19 will truly jumpstart the digital healthcare revolution. While it has certainly accelerated the adoption of digital solutions, many of the aforementioned obstacles still remain in place. Going forward, it will be important to create an enabling environment that ensures that digital healthcare can reach its full potential and continue to play an important role in providing quality patient care.
